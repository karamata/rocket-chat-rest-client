# rocket-chat-rest-client
Lightweight Java client for [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/)'s [REST API](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api) using [Unirest](http://unirest.io/java.html) and [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind).

## Notes
* Rocket.Chat v0.48 rewrote the REST API, see the [pull request #5140](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/5140) for details
* This api is still a work in progress, feel free to submit pull requests to add functionality
* Server url doesn't require `api/` anymore, but it can still be provided
* None of the results are cached, every time a method is called it goes out and gets it
* The method calls are sync and blocking
* Maven is configured to startup Rocket.Chat v.0.48-develop via docker therefore docker must be installed.

### Java
```java
RocketChatClient rc = new RocketChatClient("https://demo.rocket.chat/api/", "<user>", "<password>");

// get meta info
System.out.println("Rocket.Chat Server Version is: " + info.getServerInformation().getVersion());
		
// use typed API to retrieve rooms		
Room[] channels = rc.getChannels();
for (Room c : channels) {
	System.out.println(String.format("name: %s, id: %s", c.getName(), c.getId()));
}

//NOTE: Sending a message isn't supported yet, due to inconsistencies that `v1/chat.postMessage` has versus other `v1/` APIs. 
// send a message to a room. Room ID is resolved automatically
rc.send("test", "Hello from REST client" + new Date());

// Call this if you are done or want to refresh the auth token
rc.logout();
```

### build docker images

Step 1 : download docker from here https://www.docker.com/ install and start docker

Step 2 : build our images by using docker-compose

# docker-compose build

Step 3 : run our images
# docker-compose run

### Compiling

The maven build needs [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for integration testing. Please install it for your platform before running

```
mvn clean install
```

To keep the docker containers running:

```
mvn -Ddocker.keepRunning clean install
```
